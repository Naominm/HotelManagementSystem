                    <br>Classically trained in the former from Johnson and Whales University,<br> I have taken my talents throughout Maine,
                    <br> from the exciting fast paced restaurants of Portland<br> to the sleepy shores of \Vinalhaven Island off the coast of Rockland,<br> and everywhere in between. <br>My work as a pastry chef has been featured in both Downeast magazine
                    <br> and the Portland Press Herald.
                    <br> my aim is to share my experiences through great story telling,<br> passion for learning, teaching, having fun and my love of travel.<br> I hope to one day be able to travel the globe,<br> trying every dessert and petting every cat!</p>

            only 15 when she began working in the food industry at the Muffin Shop in Marblehead, Massachusetts.<br> She graduated in 2007 from Johnson & Wales University<br> and returned to Boston to begin her career at the Top of the Hub restaurant.<br>        From there, she went to work with Barbara Lynch Gruppo as a line cook at B&G Oysters,<br> where she quickly rose through the ranks to the position of sous chef.<br>
    
            <br>Stephanie continued to further hone her fine-dining skills at restaurants like Stir and No. 9 Park,<br> eventually showcasing her culinary prowess by competing on Top Chef.<br> After the show, she opened the pop-up Stacked Donuts in Boston.<br>        In 2015, Stephanie joined Fairsted Kitchen as the executive chef,<br> crafting a menu that reflects her personal cooking style with French <br>and Italian dishes that have a Middle Eastern spin.
